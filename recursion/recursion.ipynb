Different from the memoization technique, tail recursion could optimize the space complexity of the algorithm, by eliminating the stack overhead incurred by recursion. More importantly, with tail recursion, one could avoid the problem of stack overflow that comes often with recursion. Another advantage about tail recursion is that often times it is easier to read and understand, compared to non-tail-recursion. \n",
