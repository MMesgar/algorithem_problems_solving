    "- The most popular algorithm for “topological sorting” is Kahn’s algorithm. \n",
    "\n",
    "- “Topological sorting” only works with graphs that are directed and acyclic. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Topological sorting works based on the indegree of nodes. We start with a node with an indegree of zero. We put in the output and remove it from the graph. We reduce the indegree of its neighbours by one (because we remvoed the). Then we remove the node with indegree 0. We continute until we process all nodes. \n",
    "\n",
    "- There must be at least one vertex in the “graph” with an “in-degree” of 0. If all vertices in the “graph” have a non-zero “in-degree”, then all vertices need at least one vertex as a predecessor. In this case, no vertex can serve as the starting vertex.\n",
