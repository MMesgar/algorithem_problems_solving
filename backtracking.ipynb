Since not each direction is available though, one should check if the cell in the given direction is an obstacle or it has been cleaned before, i.e. is_valid(candidate). Another benefit of the check is that it would greatly reduce the number of possible paths that one needs to explore.\n",

The backtracking would be triggered whenever the robot reaches a point that it is surrounded either by the obstacles (e.g. cell at the row 1 and the column -3) or the cleaned cells. At the end of the backtracking, the robot would get back to the its starting point, and each cell in the grid would be traversed at least once. As a result, the room is cleaned at the end."
