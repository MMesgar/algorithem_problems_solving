    "- grids can be generaly transformed to graphs. \n",

    "- in BFS for tracing the path, define a hashmap (dictionary) for each node and keep the path until to that node. When you explore childern of a node, then add that child to the path to define the new path for each node. To keep track of shortest path length, use a dictionary and save the length from source to each node. A more efficient way could be to save each node in the visited node as a pair. \n",

    "- if an optimization problem with multiple constraints (e.g. shortest path and minimum number of nodes) should be applied to a graph, define a dictionary for each constraint. Validate each node for each constraint. Add each node to the queue if any condition holds. An alternative idea is to use iterative optimizatoin. We fix one constraint and optimize for one the second constraint. Then we change the value for the second constraint and then optimize for the first constraint. \n",

What is important is to check the edge case at the end. If there is no node with indegree 0 then there is no topologial sorted output. You should return an empty list. To check this, the len of the output should be identical to the number of nodes in the graph. \n",

    "\n",
    "- when you are dealing with length of array (not the capcity), you can use the ``n=len(arr)`` command. It give you the number of items in the arr. If you remove one item from the arr, n decreases by 1. However, some tasks want you  not to touch the rest of the array. \n",
